# Microbot
This is a **fun side project** inspired by **Old School RuneScape**.  
The main motivation? To learn, share, and help other people program by building tools, scripts, and experiments around one of the most nostalgic games ever made.  

Think of it less like “serious enterprise software” and more like a playground where the game is coding itself.  

If you’ve ever thought *“what if I could learn programming while messing around with RuneScape?”* — you’re in the right place.
