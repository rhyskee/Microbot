## Branching Model

- **Fork → Development → Main**
  - You must **fork this repository** first.  
  - All pull requests must target the **`development`** branch of the upstream Microbot repository.  
  - **`main`** is protected and updated only by **Mocrosoft**, who merges from `development` into `main`.  

- **Repository scope**
  - This repository accepts **client changes only**.  
  - **No scripts are allowed** here.
